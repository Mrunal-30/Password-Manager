#PassOp – A Simple Password Manager
PassOp is a lightweight password manager built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. It allows users to securely store, view, and manage their passwords locally in the browser using localStorage. With a clean, responsive user interface, PassOp provides the essential features you need without any backend or external database, making it ideal for personal or educational use.

The application lets you save passwords by entering the site name, username, and password. You can easily delete entries or copy passwords to the clipboard with a single click. All data is stored locally, so nothing is sent to a server — ensuring privacy by design.

PassOp uses React’s state management (useState and useEffect) and offers a dynamic UI experience. The layout is mobile-friendly and includes a footer component that either remains fixed at the bottom of the viewport or dynamically appears below your content depending on configuration. Styling is handled entirely through Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistent design.

To get started, clone the repository, run npm install to install dependencies, and launch the app using npm run dev. The project uses Vite for fast development server startup, and your app will typically be available at http://localhost:5173/.

The folder structure is simple and modular. Core components like Manager.jsx handle the main logic and user interface, while the Footer.jsx component displays brand and copyright information.

Please note, PassOp stores passwords in localStorage without encryption, so it's not recommended for sensitive data in production. This project is intended as a learning tool and can be extended with features like encryption, dark mode, user authentication, or even a backend API for persistence.
